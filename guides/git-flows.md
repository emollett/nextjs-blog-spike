# What is it


# Why do you need to know



# A bit more
<!-- You might hear people talking about **branches**, which are copies of the code which you can make different changes to. You might create branches for new features, so there will be multiple branches of the code, each of which are slightly different. You deploy from you main branch, so when you want to update that with the variation, you can merge the branch back in. Working on different branchest means developers can work on their changes without making any changes to the code that is deployed until they are ready for their changes to be deployed. -->
